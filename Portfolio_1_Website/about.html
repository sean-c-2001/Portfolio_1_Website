                    Galway City is the fourth largest city in Ireland in terms of population,
                    the city began to grow in 1127 around a fortificiation that was built by
                    the King of Connacht. However the population that began to grow were not
                    permitted to form a council until there was a municipal charter in 1484.
                    After this the city turned into a trading port ran by a group of Merchant
                    Families known as the Tribes of Galway.

                    Following a period of decline, in recent decades Galway has become a hub for 
                    tourism and culture, not only in Ireland but across Europe. In 2020 Galway was
                    named European Capital of Culture.

                    A big reason why Galway was granted this prestigious title 
                    is probably because of the festivals held regularly in the city. Such as the 
                    Galway Arts Festival or the multiple festivals noted as coming up soon 
                    on our Home Page.

                    If this website has done its job and you are thinking about visiting 
                    our beautiful city sometime soon thrn you will need to know how to get 
                    here. The answer depends on how far youre travelling from, if you are
                    flying in from abroad you have Ireland's four airports to choose from 
                    Knock, Cork, Shannon, and of course Dublin. Galway is easily accessible 
                    from these airports by train and by motorway. The motor routes to take
                    from Dublin to Galway are the M4 and the M6.

                    In terms of weather lets just say youn won't be coming to Galway for the sun,
                    much like the rest of Ireland Galway only really has one or two months of 
                    Summer. So if youre looking to experience some culture and some typically
                    damp but occasionally sunny weather the Galway is a perfect match.
